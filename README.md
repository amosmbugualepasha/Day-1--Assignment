#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- This is an act of developing software to provide solutions or solve problems through technology.It involves designng, development and maintance of software to meet the expected requirements.
The importance is to ensure quality, scalable, and reliable software systems, driving innovation, and compliance while meeting user needs in technology industry.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 - High level programming languages - This laid the foundation for modern programming paradigms and enabled the development of more complex and scalable software systems.
 - Software Crisis and Birth of Software Engineering - It exposed the challenges of managing large-scale software projects, leading to the formalization of software engineering via methodologies, documentation and QA Checks
- Agile Methodologies 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Gathering Requirements and analysis - Ensures the software solves the right problem.
- Design & Implementation - Turns ideas into a working product
- Testing, Deployment, & Maintenance- Enures quality, usability, and long-term sustainability.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall methodology  is suited for projects with fixed requirements and a clear end goal, where changes are unlikely and documentation is critical. example is builiding a goverment tax system where requiremts are fixed and documentation of compliance is required. 
- Agile methodology is best suited  for projects requiring flexibility, frequent updates, and continuous customer involvement, especially in dynamic or innovative environments. Example is building a new mobile social Application where user feedback and continuous improvement is key for project success

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer: Builds the software by designing ,writing, testing and maintaining codes of the project
- Quality Assurance Engineer: Tests and ensures quality by Validating that the software meets requirements and is user-ready.
- Project Manager: Manages the team and project delivery ie overseeing the project

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- IDEs: Enhance developer productivity by providing tools for coding, debugging, and testing (e.g., Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA
- VCS: Ensures code management, collaboration, and version tracking (e.g., Git, SVN).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Tight Deadlines: Software engineers can overcome this by application of project management tools example Jira to ensure they cover priorities
- Communication Gaps: This can be solved by holding regular meetings to ensure alignment, also by use of tools like google chats, mirosoft teams for quick fedbacks
- Changing Requirements:  Use Agile methodologies to adapt to changes and maintain clear communication with client and teams

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit Testing - Ensures individual components work correctly.
- Integration Testing - Checks interactions between components.
- System Testing - Validates the entire systemâ€™s functionality.
- Acceptance Testing - Confirms the software meets user and business requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- This is the art of making AI models (think and learn) by giving commands/instructions to AI models to ensure quality and effective outputs are tailored

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- Vague Prompt: example is like"Tell me about history.This is too broad and unclear
- Improved Prompt ensures specific and clarity is maintained. Example is tell me about software develpoment history and evolution.
